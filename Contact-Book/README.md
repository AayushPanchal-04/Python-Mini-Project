## 👀 View Contact

Displays the stored details of a contact by entering the contact name.  
If the contact does not exist, an appropriate message is shown.

---

## ✏️ Update Contact

Enables modification of an existing contact’s age, email, and mobile number.  
Only existing contacts can be updated.

## ❌ Delete Contact

Deletes a contact permanently from the contact book using the contact name.

---

## 🔍 Search Contact

Searches contacts using a full or partial name.  
The search feature is case-insensitive for better usability.

---

## 🔢 Count Contact

Displays the total number of contacts currently stored in the contact book.

---

## 📖 Usage

Run the application from the terminal and choose options from the menu to perform different contact operations.  
The program continues running until the user selects the Exit option.

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project folder, and run the Python file using Python 3.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

The project consists of a main Python file for the application logic and a README file for documentation.

## 🔍 How It Works

- Contact data is stored in memory using Python dictionaries  
- User input determines the operation to perform  
- The dictionary is updated based on user actions  
- The menu repeats until the user exits the program
