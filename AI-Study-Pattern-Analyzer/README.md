# 🎓 AI Study Pattern Analyzer PRO

A **professional desktop application** designed to help students **understand, analyze, and improve their study habits** using data-driven insights and intelligent recommendations.

This project combines **modern UI design**, **analytics**, and **AI-inspired logic** to deliver a real-world productivity tool rather than a basic academic demo.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

AI Study Pattern Analyzer PRO allows users to log their daily study sessions and transforms that data into **meaningful insights**.

Instead of only tracking time, the application focuses on:
- Study patterns
- Consistency
- Productivity
- Burnout detection

The goal of this project is to simulate how **real productivity software** works while remaining **fully offline and privacy-friendly**.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is intentionally designed as a **single-file application** to simplify execution, review, and evaluation.

All logic, UI components, database handling, and analytics are contained within one file, making the project **easy to understand, demonstrate, and maintain**.

---

## 🧠 Intelligence & Logic Design

The AI system is implemented using **rule-based decision logic**, focusing on **explainability** rather than black-box machine learning models.

Key intelligence concepts include:
- Average study session evaluation  
- Consistency tracking  
- Burnout threshold identification  
- Productivity scoring heuristics  

This approach ensures **reliable and transparent insights** without relying on external APIs or internet access.
